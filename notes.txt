1. Centering with margins
    - display : block
    - must have a width
    - margin left/right : auto

2. The box model
    margin-->padding-->border-->content

3. Why cant we have two block-level buttons?
    when we use display : block, it takes up the entire horizontal 
    space of the webpage, so if we add another button it pushes down. If we remove block the buttons are arranged side by side
    but the auto margin does not work. We have 2 options to solve this issue - 1. text-inline 2. flexbox

4. flex box
    justify-content : center --> pushes the content in the center
    justify-content : end --> pushes the content to the complete right
    justify-content: first baseline --> pushes the content to the left

5. By default <div>'s are stacked upon each other - display : block by default
        <div>
        <div>
        <div>
    if we use display : flex --> <div><div><div>, each of the item gets its own
    column.
    justify-content - pushes along the horizontal axis --> (start,end,center,space-around.space-between,space-evenly)
    align-items - pushes along the vertical axis | (start,end,center)
    align-items by default has the value stretch
