1. Centering with margins
    - display : block
    - must have a width
    - margin left/right : auto

2. The box model
    margin-->padding-->border-->content

3. Why cant we have two block-level buttons?
    when we use display : block, it takes up the entire horizontal 
    space of the webpage, so if we add another button it pushes down. If we remove block the buttons are arranged side by side
    but the auto margin does not work. We have 2 options to solve this issue - 1. text-inline 2. flexbox
