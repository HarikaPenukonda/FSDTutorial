1. Centering with margins
    - display : block
    - must have a width
    - margin left/right : auto

2. The box model
    margin-->padding-->border-->content

3. Why cant we have two block-level buttons?
    when we use display : block, it takes up the entire horizontal 
    space of the webpage, so if we add another button it pushes down. If we remove block the buttons are arranged side by side
    but the auto margin does not work. We have 2 options to solve this issue - 1. text-inline 2. flexbox

4. flex box
    justify-content : center --> pushes the content in the center
    justify-content : end --> pushes the content to the complete right
    justify-content: first baseline --> pushes the content to the left

5. By default <div>'s are stacked upon each other - display : block by default
        <div>
        <div>
        <div>
    if we use display : flex --> <div><div><div>, each of the item gets its own
    column.
    justify-content - pushes along the horizontal axis --> (start,end,center,space-around.space-between,space-evenly)
    align-items - pushes along the vertical axis | (start,end,center)
    align-items by default has the value stretch

6.  flex-direction
    
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    From the above lines the items are stacked next to each other <div><div><div>
    flex-direction : row; -> default <div><div><div>
    flex-direction : column; 
        <div>
        <div>
        <div>
    In this case, the role of justify content and align items are 
    justify-content - pushes along the vertical axis --> (start,end,center,space-around.space-between,space-evenly)
    align-items - pushes along the horizontal axis | (start,end,center)

7. onClick - eventListener

8. Document Object Model(DOM) - how we use JS to modify a website
    Document - HTML document
    Object - document keyword is a type of object in JS, html element --> JS object
    model - Representation

9. Escape -  "I\'d love the movie \"the lion king\" " - string
10. count = count + 1 --> count += 1

10. QuerySelector - Find the first matching element using a CSS selector. Flexible but slower
        Uses css selector eg: by id - #title
                              by class - .title
                              by tag - p
                              select inside another element - div p
                - use it to change content, change style, add event listeners

11. getElementById - Uses only ID, not flexible but faster

Shortcut - cmd + d - to select same word multiple times and edit
